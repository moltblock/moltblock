# Moltblock

**Moltblock** is a framework for building evolving composite intelligences.

It introduces the **Entity** as the primitive unit of intelligence — a system composed of many agents, models, and verification layers that evolves through **molting**, not chaining.

---

## Why Moltblock

Modern AI systems fail at scale because they:
- rely on single models
- propagate errors linearly
- lack persistent, verified memory

Moltblock addresses this by enabling:
- structured multi-agent intelligence
- heterogeneous model usage
- built-in verification
- irreversible knowledge checkpoints

---

## Core Concepts

- **Entity** — a composite cognitive system
- **Molt** — controlled internal evolution
- **Artifact** — signed, verifiable outputs
- **Checkpoint** — immutable state snapshots
- **Governance** — safety outside cognition

---

## What Moltblock Is Not

- Not a blockchain
- Not a single AI model
- Not a chat agent framework

Blockchain is optional and used only for anchoring.

## Docs

- [MVP Entity Spec](mvp_entity_spec.md) — agent roles, LLMs, verification, minimal loop, lifecycle (v0.2)
- [Landing page language](landing_page_language.md) — headline, copy, and diagram for moltblock.io
- [Protocol v0.1](moltblock_protocol_v_0.md) · [Architecture](composite_ai_entity_architecture.md) · [Manifesto](moltblock_manifesto.md)

---

## Roadmap

- v0.1 — Protocol + architecture
- v0.2 — MVP Entity implementation (spec complete)
- v0.3 — Multi-Entity collaboration

---

## Philosophy

Moltblock treats singularity as an emergent property of accelerating, verified collective intelligence.

If intelligence scales, it must scale with structure.
