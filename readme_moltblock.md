# Moltblock

**Moltblock** is a framework for building evolving composite intelligences.

It introduces the **Entity** as the primitive unit of intelligence — a system composed of many agents, models, and verification layers that evolves through **molting**, not chaining.

---

## Why Moltblock

Modern AI systems fail at scale because they:
- rely on single models
- propagate errors linearly
- lack persistent, verified memory

Moltblock addresses this by enabling:
- structured multi-agent intelligence
- heterogeneous model usage
- built-in verification
- irreversible knowledge checkpoints

---

## Core Concepts

- **Entity** — a composite cognitive system
- **Molt** — controlled internal evolution
- **Artifact** — signed, verifiable outputs
- **Checkpoint** — immutable state snapshots
- **Governance** — safety outside cognition

---

## What Moltblock Is Not

- Not a blockchain
- Not a single AI model
- Not a chat agent framework

Blockchain is optional and used only for anchoring.

---

## Roadmap

- v0.1 — Protocol + architecture (current)
- v0.2 — MVP Entity implementation
- v0.3 — Multi-Entity collaboration

---

## Philosophy

Moltblock treats singularity as an emergent property of accelerating, verified collective intelligence.

If intelligence scales, it must scale with structure.
